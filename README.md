#Todo Lists
##An Odin Project Assignment
The idea of this [assignment](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/javascript/lessons/todo-list?ref=lnav) is to practise javascript by building a to do list.
There's a special focus on the OO stuff and making it as clean as possible.  Well I'm still learning so I will try my best!

[The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/home) is a great resource for learning how to develop web pages.
